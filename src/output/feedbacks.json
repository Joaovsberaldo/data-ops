    "text": "UPDATE November, 2019:<br />I think it's time to put my money into a different subscription. Each month, there are fewer and fewer full and \"deluxe sample\" size products. Those that are full size aren't worth much money. There's no point of me putting my money into so many samples.<br /><br />OVERVIEW:<br />I just received my first Cocotique box. I was a little nervous, as I'm new to subscription boxes, but I'm actually quite satisfied with the products. Most of them are full-size, and others are large enough to get quite a few uses out of. The month's box (the actual cardboard box the products are in) is absolutely beautiful! Included is a card with extensive information about all of the products, including prices and where to find them should you decide to purchase them. I absolutely love that they included this because I can easily find the products if I want to order them, and I can see the value of the products versus the cost of the box ($25/month).<br /><br />PRODUCTS:<br />With that being said, the value of the products in the box is well worth the cost of the subscription (in this box, at least). The price of the products come up to about double the cost of the box (approximately $47). So, I'm happy with the value. You get more than 2 or 3 items, and they're pretty large.<br /><br />CUSTOMER SERVICE CONTACT:<br />One item (eyeshadow) was broken (still sealed). I emailed them on a Saturday and they responded within 2 or 3 hours to apologize and let me know that a replacement was on the way. I greatly appreciate the quick and polite customer service.<br /><br />SHIPPING:<br />Shipping was EXTRA fast, but...things are not safely secured in the box. I'm not sure if this is how the eyeshadow box was broken or not, but the products definitely need to be better secured. The products are packaged with pretty crinkled paper, but not enough to hold the products in place. Some products are heavier than others, which may cause some issues in some boxes. This is reason for the 4-star review. All of the products were strewn throughout the box in an unorganized way. Unfortunately, mail carriers don't (and sometimes can't) always take the time to ensure that things aren't thrown around during shipping, so more secure packaging may make things a little better.<br /><br />BILLING:<br />I have to be honest and say that the way they do their billing is a bit...odd to me. They bill on your anniversary date, even if the box isn't due to be shipped for weeks. I signed up in early to mid-March, and I just received my first box, the April box. This, of course, depends when you sign up, but when you initially sign up determines if you receive your first box for the CURRENT month or the month after. I was just now charged for next month's box, even though I just received this month's (April) box today. Again, I'm fairly new to subscription boxes and the other ones that I'm subscribed to charge on your anniversary and send your box when you're charged. YES, this is stated in multiple places on Cocotique's website and other places, so I was aware of it, but again, it's just a bit odd to me because it seems like you're waiting for a very long time for something you've paid for. But, that's the way they work and I'll more than happily deal with it to see what they have in store.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br />I will be continuing my subscription. I'm fairly new to the makeup world, so being able to try a wide variety of products (again, these products are large, so you can do a lot more than \"try\" them) without having to buy all of them one-by-one comes in handy. It saves both money and time. I've definitely told my friends about this subscription box, and I'm excited to see what will be in future boxes. I think I'll be ordering some of the past boxes, also.<br /><br />As time goes by and I receive more boxes, I'll update my review.",

Unfortunately the glass bottle inside came broken because of handling but guess what, they are replacing that at no cost to me as well. The products in this box are so well made and the designs are lovely. I am not one for mystery boxes so being able to look at spoilers on the Instagram has really made the difference for me and my expectations were exceeded by the products and the customer service. Originally I was going to give them three stars for sending me the wrong box but after all of the CS exchanges, I am giving them 5 stars.<br />I was not expecting a heating pad and it ended up being one of my favorite items in the whole box.<br />Thank you very much Pusheen box and give you a customer service reps a raise because they are wonderful and helpful and timely.

I became intrigued and went to Amazon's site to learn more. I came across the Thera Box listing and knew this was the direction. The wife is into health/beauty/spa products, and the listing for TheraBox described everything that she would like, so seemed like a win-win.<br /><br />Unfortunately the TheraBox arrived too late for her birthday, but would arrive in time for a great Christmas gift.<br /><br />My wife absolutely freaked when she opened it. Best gift ever. She marveled at the assortment of different items (full size bottles of creams & lotions, a beanie, a neck wrap, plus other goodies) contained in the box. She pressed me about the cost, as were agreed to keep gifts under $100. She couldn't believe the amazing value of items provided for under $50.<br /><br />She's now recieved her third box and still is amazed every time she gets one. She's so impressed by it that she purchased a TheraBox as a birthday gift for her best friend. And she's working on purchasing a few more for select friends & family.<br /><br />I'll probably stop the subscription in a month or 2, but I don't regret for one moment in pulling the trigger on that first purchase.",

I knew purchasing the box the shirt wouldn't fit my son so I'm not basing any of the review on that and can't say what material it was. The other items were a thin blanket or  beach towel depending what you want to use it for, a key chain, a light up button, a small pillow (a toddler could carry or put their little head on), a small tote bag, and a figure in a box.

It is not a good value considering everything they give you is worth $5. Seriously. I’ve subscribed to some pretty nice STEM boxes and this is not impressive. Save your money. In fact, I’m not sure who wrote the other reviews because it’s not a good value. I tried it for two months and will not be fooled a third time.",

    "text": "I got this from Annie and the clay is not worth the money I even tried mixing with cosclay and premo and it still would break on test I baked an 45 mins because everyone knows 15 mins isn’t enough to have strong jewelry. The glue they send is never usable I have gotten theee tubes it’s always junk . I tried for four months hoping things would change yes there is great stuff in boxes but the polymer it’s self is useless unless your gonna use it for sculpting or something else . To me it’s compatible to Amazon clay sorry Annie’s I want be getting anymore",

THE HAND MADE FIZZING CANDIES WERE INTERESTING AND THE STRAWBERRY MOUSSE LAYERED WAFFLE COOKIES IN THE SHAPE OF A FISH WERE EXCELLENT.

I now know she likes all of the items in the first box, but her favorite is the Bully Sticks.  I can order just those as my dog and I wait for her next box of chew treats to arrive.  This is perfect as my dog is a pup going through that first year of chewing.  With these treats, there is no destruction of things around the house.  She is kept busy enjoying the chew treats.",
